## About Me

Hi, I'm Rama — a Senior Software Engineer at Wipro who loves building high-impact web applications and sharing ideas through side projects like `therama.dev`.

### What I Do
- Architect and ship performant javascript applications with clean, reusable component patterns.
- Mentor teams on Angular, modern React tooling, TailwindCSS flows, and frontend performance debugging.
- Tinker with UI motion and accessibility to make every interaction feel intentional.

### Beyond the Keyboard
When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me outdoors, on a trip, or hanging with family and friends. I'm also into gaming, movies, cricket, tennis, cooking, photography, and spending time with my dog.
